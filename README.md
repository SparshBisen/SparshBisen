- 👋 Hi, I’m @SparshBisen
- 👀 I’m interested in Android Developoment    
- 🌱 I’m currently learning to build a app using Flutter Framework in Android Studio
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on open source projects and as well as looking for a mentor who can get me to solve real world problems.
-  :fist_raised: Created a partially functional app called MittiMitti using Jotform, this app is for farmers which acknowledge about the soil condition. This app will tell the basic needs of soil like, water needed, quantity of fertilizer required and other important ratios which can lead for best cultivation.
